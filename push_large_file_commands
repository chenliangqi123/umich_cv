1.	安装和初始化 Git LFS：
brew install git-lfs  # macOS
git lfs install
2.	跟踪大文件：
git lfs track "A1/cifar-10-python.tar.gz"
3.	提交 .gitattributes 文件：
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
4.	移除并重新添加大文件：
git rm --cached A1/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
git add A1/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
git commit -m "Move large files to Git LFS"
5.	推送更改到远程仓库：
git push origin master


I managed to solve this issue by using Git LFS's migrate command. Here are the steps to resolve the problem:

Step 1: Install Git LFS First, if you haven't already installed Git LFS, you can do so with the following command:

git lfs install
Step 2: Use git lfs migrate To move the large file into Git LFS, use the migrate command as follows:

git lfs migrate import --include="src/data/indonesia-cities.json"
This will rewrite your Git history to move the large file into LFS.

Step 3: Add and Commit Changes Now you should stage and commit the .gitattributes file and the large file itself:

git add .gitattributes src/data/indonesia-cities.json
git commit -m "Migrate large file to Git LFS"
Step 4: Push to Remote Repository Finally, push your changes to your remote repository:

git push origin your-branch-name
Note: Be cautious when using history rewriting commands like git lfs migrate, especially on shared repositories. Always backup your repository and inform your collaborators to re-clone after such changes.
